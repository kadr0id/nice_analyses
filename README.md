This is a project to show my approach to programming and show how I would start a new project.
Nice analyses

## Getting Started üöÄ
---

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit and widget tests use the following command:

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

---

## Generating assets üñºÔ∏è

We're using [flutter_gen](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen) to generate statically safe descriptions of image and font assets.

You need to install the `flutter_gen` tool via brew or pub, by following the [installation instruction](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gen/install). The configuration of the tool is stored in `pubspec.yaml`.

After that you can easily recreate the assets descriptions by calling:

```bash
$> fluttergen
```

Then to reference the asset you can call:

```dart
Assets.images.unicornVgvBlack.image(height: 120),
```

If you're adding new assets to ui library, make sure to run `fluttergen` inside the package directory as well.

## Working with Translations üåê

This project relies on [flutter_localizations](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations-library.html) and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization).

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the NiceApp of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the NiceApp of the Counter Page"
    },
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
        "description": "Hello World Text"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:abra/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale.

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ l10n
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app_en.arb
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Counter",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Text shown in the AppBar of the Counter Page"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "counterAppBarTitle": "Contador",
    "@counterAppBarTitle": {
        "description": "Texto mostrado en la AppBar de la p√°gina del contador"
    }
}
